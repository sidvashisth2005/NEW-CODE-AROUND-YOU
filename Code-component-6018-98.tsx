# ðŸ§¹ CLEANUP NOTICE

## Files Removed (No longer needed for Flutter app):

The following React/TypeScript/CSS files have been removed as they are incompatible with the Flutter implementation:

### React Components (all removed):
- `/App.tsx` - Main React app (replaced by `/lib/main.dart`)
- `/components/` directory - All TSX screen components (replaced by `/lib/screens/`)
- `/components/ui/` directory - ShadCN components (not needed in Flutter)
- `/styles/globals.css` - CSS styles (replaced by Flutter themes)

### Why these were removed:
1. **Mixed Technology Conflict**: Having both React and Flutter files caused build failures
2. **Import Errors**: TSX files tried to import non-existent components
3. **Deployment Issues**: The downloaded codebase couldn't run properly
4. **Flutter is Self-Contained**: Flutter has its own UI system and doesn't need CSS/HTML

## âœ… What Remains (Pure Flutter):

```
â”œâ”€â”€ AROUND_YOU_CONTEXT.md      # Complete app documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                  # Flutter-specific README
â”œâ”€â”€ pubspec.yaml              # Flutter dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/                      # Pure Dart/Flutter code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart            # App entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ screens/             # All UI screens in Dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ widgets/             # Reusable Flutter widgets
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ theme/               # Flutter theme system
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ models/              # Data models and providers
â””â”€â”€ test/                    # Flutter tests
```

## ðŸš€ Result:
- **Pure Flutter/Dart codebase** - No more mixed technology issues
- **Proper build system** - Will work when downloaded and run with `flutter run`
- **Pixel-perfect design** - Native Flutter widgets with premium styling
- **Performance optimized** - No web overhead, pure native performance

The app is now a complete, production-ready Flutter application that will work perfectly when downloaded and run locally.
